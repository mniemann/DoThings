DoThings
========

A simple task manager


DoThings helps you get your stuff done in a timely fashion. It doesn't
nag you. It assumes you are an adult.

Here's how to use it:

Tap on "Now," "Soon," or "Later" to see what you were planning
on doing.

Tap any "+" sign on the right of the screen to add a new item.

Tap the calendar icon to select a different date than the default. To
cancel, just tap "Now," "Soon," or "Later" again.

Tap any uncompleted item to edit it. Change the text and/or the
date.

To mark an item completed, right swipe across it. A left swipe
will restore the item. Once an item has been marked completed, a single
tap will delete the item.
